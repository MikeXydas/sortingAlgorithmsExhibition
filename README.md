# sortingAlgorithmsExhibition
Algorithms included: heapsort, quicksort, insertsort (with and without binary search), mergesort, selection sort (recursive), bubble sort (recursive)

Compile: make

Execution:

-Full printing: ./main SIZE_OF_VECTOR (it will print the vector before and after the search)

-No printing of vector: ./main SIZE_OF_VECTOR -v (suggested for big sizes)
