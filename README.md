# Sorting Algorithms Exhibition

## Content

Algorithms included: **heapsort, quicksort, insertsort (with and without binary search), mergesort, selection sort (recursive), bubble sort (recursive).**
 
You will be able to run a series of sorting algorithms comparing their CPU running time

## Compile and run
Compile: `make`

Execution:

- **Full printing:** `./main SIZE_OF_VECTOR` (it will print the vector before and after the search)  
- **No printing of vector**: `./main SIZE_OF_VECTOR -v` (suggested for big sizes)
